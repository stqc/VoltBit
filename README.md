# VoltBit

**The Official VoltBit Repo**

Voltbit was created as a way to help combat poverty and
climate change. In many Third-World countries and under-developed areas, having electricity is currently a struggle due to lack of funding or availability. 
With Voltbit, we hope to change this. A 1% fee is taken for every transaction, which goes to a charity wallet. This will then go to various charities who work towards reducing C02 emissions with solar energy. As donations are made to these charities we will share the donation amount on our website to prove that the donation has happened, as well as share the good things our strong community has accomplished
